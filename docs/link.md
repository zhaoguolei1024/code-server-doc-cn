# code-server --link

> Note: This feature is no longer recommended due to instability. Stay tuned for a revised version.

Run code-server with the flag `--link` and you'll get TLS, authentication, and a dedicated URL
for accessing your IDE out of the box.

```console
$ code-server --link
Proxying code-server, you can access your IDE at https://example.coder.co
```
